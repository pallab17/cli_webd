Command line techniques and directory navigation -->

     work                                           command

1. list files and directories                         ls

2. change directories                                 cd


cd ~ --> root level

cd .. --> return back to previous folder/directory

for backward traversal --> we have to write the entire directory of the target traversal

for forward traversal --> we have to write the folder name of the target traversal


editing the commands -->

ctrl plus A --> start of command line
ctrl plus E --> end of command line
ctrl plus U --> undo command line

alt + click mouse --> edit at a faster speed at a random position

left and right arrows to traverse the command
